### DIY PYTHON POKEMON GAME

This project serves as my final assignment for one of my courses. I am tasked with developing a simple Pokémon battle system game, implemented in Python and leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 
The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate my understanding and application of OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation, while also showcasing my ability to design and develop a functional game system. 
This project will encompass creating various Pokémon with unique attributes and abilities, implementing battle mechanics, and ensuring an engaging and interactive gameplay experience.
